# My Name

As a Croatian with a Croatian name, my name can pose challenges for non-Croats.

The Croatian language is (mostly) phonetic, i.e.,
every letter corresponds to exactly one sound.
The trouble is that the sounds are not exactly the same as in English or German
(also, there are [accents](https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naglasak),
which are typically not written).
[Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/?sl=hr&tl=en&text=Petar%20Mlinari%C4%87&op=translate)
does a decent job, though quite robotic.
Usually, I go by "Peter" in English or German-speaking countries.

Officially, the last letter in my last name is "ć"
(LaTeX: `\'c`).
In foreign documents, I replace it with "c".
