                 preserve network structure in linear multi-agent systems. Here,
                 we extend this approach to a class of nonlinear network
                 systems. Additionally, we generalize our clustering method
                 which restores the network structure in an arbitrary
                 reduced-order model obtained by projection. We demonstrate this
                 method on a number of examples.",

                 All methods are implemented in terms of abstract vector and

                 pyMOR's algorithms with a wide array of external PDE solvers.
