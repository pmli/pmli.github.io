                 reduction of leader-follower multi-agent networks by clustering
                 was studied. For such multi-agent networks, a reduced order
                 network is obtained by partitioning the set of nodes in the
                 graph into disjoint sets, called clusters, and associating with
                 each cluster a single, new, node in a reduced network graph. In
                 Monshizadeh et al. (2014), this method was studied for the
                 special case that the agents have single integrator dynamics.
                 For a special class of graph partitions, called almost
                 equitable partitions, an explicit formula was derived for the
                 {\(\mathcal H_2\)} model reduction error. In the present paper,
                 we will extend and generalize the results from Monshizadeh et
                 al. (2014) in a number of directions. Firstly, we will
                 establish an a priori upper bound for the {\(\mathcal H_2\)}
                 model reduction error in case that the agent dynamics is an
                 arbitrary multivariable input-state-output system. Secondly,
                 for the single integrator case, we will derive an explicit
                 formula for the {\(\mathcal H_\infty\)} model reduction error.
                 Thirdly, we will prove an a priori upper bound for the
                 {\(\mathcal H_\infty\)} model reduction error in case that the
                 agent dynamics is a symmetric multivariable input-state-output
                 system. Finally, we will consider the problem of obtaining a
                 priori upper bounds if we cluster using arbitrary, possibly non
                 almost equitable, partitions.",

                 in low-energy nuclear physics because they enable fast and
                 accurate sampling of high-fidelity calculations, enabling
                 robust uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we develop,
                 implement, and test two model-driven emulators based on the
                 (Petrov-)Galerkin projection using the prototypical test case
                 of two-body scattering with the Minnesota potential and a more
                 realistic local chiral potential. The high-fidelity scattering
                 equations are solved with the matrix Numerov method, a
                 reformulation of the popular Numerov recurrence relation for
                 solving special second-order differential equations as a linear
                 system of coupled equations. A novel error estimator based on
                 reduced-space residuals is applied to an active learning
                 approach (a greedy algorithm) to choosing training samples
                 ({"}snapshots{"}) for the emulator and contrasted with a proper
                 orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach. Both approaches allow
                 for computationally efficient offline-online decompositions,
                 but the greedy approach requires many fewer snapshot
                 calculations. These developments set the groundwork for
                 emulating scattering observables based on chiral
                 nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions and optical
                 models, where computational speed-ups are necessary for
                 Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Our emulators and error
                 estimators are widely applicable to linear systems.",
