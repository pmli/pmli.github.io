                 Model Reduction of Multi-Agent Systems Using Graph Partitions,
                 IEEE Trans Control Netw Syst 1(2):145-154, 2014], model
                 reduction of leader-follower multi-agent networks by clustering
                 was studied. For such multi-agent networks, a reduced order
                 network is obtained by partitioning the set of nodes in the
                 graph into disjoint sets, called clusters, and associating with
                 each cluster a single, new, node in a reduced network graph. In
                 Monshizadeh et al. (2014), this method was studied for the
                 special case that the agents have single integrator dynamics.
                 For a special class of graph partitions, called almost
                 equitable partitions, an explicit formula was derived for the
                 {\(\mathcal H_2\)} model reduction error. In the present paper,
                 we will extend and generalize the results from Monshizadeh et
                 al. (2014) in a number of directions. Firstly, we will
                 establish an a priori upper bound for the {\(\mathcal H_2\)}
                 model reduction error in case that the agent dynamics is an
                 arbitrary multivariable input-state-output system. Secondly,
                 for the single integrator case, we will derive an explicit
                 formula for the {\(\mathcal H_\infty\)} model reduction error.
                 Thirdly, we will prove an a priori upper bound for the
                 {\(\mathcal H_\infty\)} model reduction error in case that the
                 agent dynamics is a symmetric multivariable input-state-output
                 system. Finally, we will consider the problem of obtaining a
                 priori upper bounds if we cluster using arbitrary, possibly non
                 almost equitable, partitions.",
