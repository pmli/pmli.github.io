                 H_2\)}-optimal reduced-order modeling of non-parametric linear
                 time-invariant (LTI) systems are known and well-investigated.
                 In this work, using the general framework of {\(\mathcal
                 L_2\)}-optimal reduced-order modeling of parametric stationary
                 problems, we derive interpolatory {\(\mathcal H_2 \otimes
                 \mathcal L_2\)}-optimality conditions for parametric LTI
                 systems with a general pole-residue form. We then specialize
                 this result to recover known conditions for systems with
                 parameter-independent poles and develop new conditions for a
                 certain class of systems with parameter-dependent poles.",

                 algebraic variety called the real generic determinantal
                 variety. An explicit description of the tangent cone to that
                 variety is given in Theorem 3.2 of Schneider and Uschmajew
                 [SIAM J. Optim., 25 (2015), pp. 622-646]. The present paper
                 shows that the proof therein is incomplete and provides a
                 proof. It also reviews equivalent descriptions of the tangent
                 cone to that variety. Moreover, it shows that the tangent cone
                 and the algebraic tangent cone to that variety coincide, which
                 is not true for all real algebraic varieties.",
