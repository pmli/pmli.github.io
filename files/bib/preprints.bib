  abstract =     "We provide a unifying framework for {\(\mathcal L_2\)}-optimal
                 reduced-order modeling for linear time-invariant dynamical
                 systems and stationary parametric problems. Using
                 parameter-separable forms of the reduced-model quantities, we
                 derive the gradients of the {\(\mathcal L_2\)} cost function
                 with respect to the reduced matrices, which then allows a
                 non-intrusive, data-driven, gradient-based descent algorithm to
                 construct the optimal approximant using only output samples. By
                 choosing an appropriate measure, the framework covers both
                 continuous (Lebesgue) and discrete cost functions. We show the
                 efficacy of the proposed algorithm via various numerical
                 examples. Furthermore, we analyze under what conditions the
                 data-driven approximant can be obtained via projection.",

  abstract =     "We develop a unifying framework for interpolatory {\(\mathcal
                 L_2\)}-optimal reduced-order modeling for a wide classes of
                 problems ranging from stationary models to parametric dynamical
                 systems. We first show that the framework naturally covers the
                 well-known interpolatory necessary conditions for {\(\mathcal
                 L_2\)}-optimal model order reduction and leads to the
                 interpolatory conditions for {\(\mathcal H_2 \otimes \mathcal
                 L_2\)}-optimal model order reduction of
                 multi-input/multi-output parametric dynamical systems.
                 Moreover, we derive novel interpolatory optimality conditions
                 for rational discrete least-squares minimization and for
                 {\(\mathcal L_2\)}-optimal model order reduction of a class of
                 parametric stationary models. We show that bitangential Hermite
                 interpolation appears as the main tool for optimality across
                 different domains. The theoretical results are illustrated on
                 two numerical examples.",
