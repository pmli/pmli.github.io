                 time-invariant (LTI) systems are well-known. Based on previous
                 work on {\(\mathcal L_2\)}-optimal reduced-order modeling of
                 stationary parametric problems, in this paper we develop and
                 investigate optimality conditions for {\(\mathcal
                 H_2\)}-optimal reduced-order modeling of structured LTI
                 systems, in particular, for second-order, port-Hamiltonian, and
                 time-delay systems. We show that across all these different
                 structured settings, bitangential Hermite interpolation is the
                 common form for optimality, thus proving a unifying optimality
                 framework for structured reduced-order modeling.",

                 time-invariant (LTI) systems are known and well-investigated.
                 In this work, using the general framework of {\(\mathcal
                 L_2\)}-optimal reduced-order modeling of parametric stationary
                 problems, we derive interpolatory {\(\mathcal H_2 \otimes
                 \mathcal L_2\)}-optimality conditions for parametric LTI
                 systems with a general pole-residue form. We then specialize
                 this result to recover known conditions for systems with
                 parameter-independent poles and develop new conditions for a
                 certain class of systems with parameter-dependent poles.",
