  abstract =     "This thesis considers structure-preserving system-theoretic
                 model order reduction for certain structured input-output
                 systems, particularly network systems. In the first part, our
                 focus lies on the clustering-based approach to reduce network
                 systems. Therein, we begin by considering clustering-based
                 model order reduction for linear multi-agent systems. This
                 approach finds a reduced model whose dynamics evolve over a
                 smaller network. To measure the reduction error, we use the
                 {\(\mathcal H_2\)}-norm and consider the {\(\mathcal
                 H_2\)}-optimal clustering problem. Since clustering is
                 generally a difficult combinatorial problem, we propose a
                 framework based on relaxing the discrete problem to find an
                 {\(\mathcal H_2\)}-suboptimal clustering. Following on this, we
                 directly extend the framework to a class of nonlinear
                 multi-agent systems. Next, we derive upper bounds for
                 {\(\mathcal H_2\)} and {\(\mathcal H_\infty\)} clustering-based
                 reduction errors for linear multi-agent systems based on almost
                 equitable partitions. These results generalize work for
                 multi-agent systems with single-integrator agents. Using a
                 similar approach for power systems, which are a special class
                 of nonlinear multi-agent systems, we find conditions for exact
                 clustering-based reduction. Additionally, we study subsystem
                 reduction for network systems. We propose a balancing-based
                 approach that guarantees stability preservation under a
                 small-gain condition. Furthermore, we consider the {\(\mathcal
                 H_2\)}-optimal subsystem reduction problem. We derive
                 Gramian-based first-order necessary {\(\mathcal
                 H_2\)}-optimality conditions and use a gradient-based
                 optimization method to fulfill them. Finally, we apply the
                 structure-preserving {\(\mathcal H_2\)}-optimal model reduction
                 approach for network systems to other structured systems. In
                 particular, we consider {\(\mathcal H_2\)}-optimal model order
                 reduction of second-order systems, port-Hamiltonian systems,
                 time-delay systems and {\(\mathcal H_2 \otimes \mathcal
                 L_2\)}-optimal model order reduction of parametric systems.
                 Here, we also derive Gramian-based {\(\mathcal
                 H_2\)}-optimality conditions and use an optimization approach
                 to construct a reduced model. For some structured systems, we
                 also derive interpolatory {\(\mathcal H_2\)}-optimality
                 conditions under additional assumptions on the reduced model.",
