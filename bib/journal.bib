                 reduction to a broad class of parametric linear time-invariant
                 systems. To this end, we derive first-order necessary
                 optimality conditions for a class of structured reduced-order
                 models and then, building on those, propose a
                 stability-preserving optimization-based method for computing
                 locally {\(\mathcal H_2 \otimes \mathcal L_2\)}-optimal
                 reduced-order models. We also make a theoretical comparison to
                 existing approaches in the literature and, in numerical
                 experiments, show how our new method, with reasonable
                 computational effort, produces stable optimized reduced-order
                 models with significantly lower approximation errors.",

                 Model Reduction of Multi-Agent Systems Using Graph Partitions,
                 IEEE Trans Control Netw Syst 1(2):145-154, 2014], model
                 reduction of leader-follower multi-agent networks by clustering
                 was studied. For such multi-agent networks, a reduced order
                 network is obtained by partitioning the set of nodes in the
                 graph into disjoint sets, called clusters, and associating with
                 each cluster a single, new, node in a reduced network graph. In
                 Monshizadeh et al. (2014), this method was studied for the
                 special case that the agents have single integrator dynamics.
                 For a special class of graph partitions, called almost
                 equitable partitions, an explicit formula was derived for the
                 {\(\mathcal H_2\)} model reduction error. In the present paper,
                 we will extend and generalize the results from Monshizadeh et
                 al. (2014) in a number of directions. Firstly, we will
                 establish an a priori upper bound for the {\(\mathcal H_2\)}
                 model reduction error in case that the agent dynamics is an
                 arbitrary multivariable input-state-output system. Secondly,
                 for the single integrator case, we will derive an explicit
                 formula for the {\(\mathcal H_\infty\)} model reduction error.
                 Thirdly, we will prove an a priori upper bound for the
                 {\(\mathcal H_\infty\)} model reduction error in case that the
                 agent dynamics is a symmetric multivariable input-state-output
                 system. Finally, we will consider the problem of obtaining a
                 priori upper bounds if we cluster using arbitrary, possibly non
                 almost equitable, partitions.",

                 parameter-separable forms of the reduced-model quantities, we

                 construct the optimal approximant using only output samples. By
                 choosing an appropriate measure, the framework covers both
                 continuous (Lebesgue) and discrete cost functions. We show the
                 efficacy of the proposed algorithm via various numerical
