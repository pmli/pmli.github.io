  abstract =     "We develop a unifying framework for interpolatory {\(\mathcal
                 L_2\)}-optimal reduced-order modeling for a wide classes of
                 problems ranging from stationary models to parametric dynamical
                 systems. We first show that the framework naturally covers the
                 well-known interpolatory necessary conditions for {\(\mathcal
                 L_2\)}-optimal model order reduction and leads to the
                 interpolatory conditions for {\(\mathcal H_2 \otimes \mathcal
                 L_2\)}-optimal model order reduction of
                 multi-input/multi-output parametric dynamical systems.
                 Moreover, we derive novel interpolatory optimality conditions
                 for rational discrete least-squares minimization and for
                 {\(\mathcal L_2\)}-optimal model order reduction of a class of
                 parametric stationary models. We show that bitangential Hermite
                 interpolation appears as the main tool for optimality across
                 different domains. The theoretical results are illustrated on
                 two numerical examples.",
