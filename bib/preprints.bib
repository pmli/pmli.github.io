  abstract =     "Interpolatory necessary optimality conditions for {\(\mathcal
                 H_2\)}-optimal reduced-order modeling of unstructured linear
                 time-invariant (LTI) systems are well-known. Based on previous
                 work on {\(\mathcal L_2\)}-optimal reduced-order modeling of
                 stationary parametric problems, in this paper we develop and
                 investigate optimality conditions for {\(\mathcal
                 H_2\)}-optimal reduced-order modeling of structured LTI
                 systems, in particular, for second-order, port-Hamiltonian, and
                 time-delay systems. We show that across all these different
                 structured settings, bitangential Hermite interpolation is the
                 common form for optimality, thus proving a unifying optimality
                 framework for structured reduced-order modeling.",
