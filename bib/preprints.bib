  abstract =     "Applications of reduced basis method emulators are increasing
                 in low-energy nuclear physics because they enable fast and
                 accurate sampling of high-fidelity calculations, enabling
                 robust uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we develop,
                 implement, and test two model-driven emulators based on
                 (Petrov-)Galerkin projection using the prototypical test case
                 of two-body scattering with the Minnesota potential and a more
                 realistic local chiral potential. The high-fidelity scattering
                 equations are solved with the matrix Numerov method, a
                 reformulation of the popular Numerov recurrence relation for
                 solving special second-order differential equations as a linear
                 system of coupled equations. A novel error estimator based on
                 reduced-space residuals is applied to an active learning
                 approach (a greedy algorithm) to choosing training samples
                 ({"}snapshots{"}) for the emulator and contrasted with a proper
                 orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach. Both approaches allow
                 for computationally efficient offline-online decompositions,
                 but the greedy approach requires much fewer snapshot
                 calculations. These developments set the groundwork for
                 emulating scattering observables based on chiral
                 nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions and optical
                 models, where computational speed-ups are necessary for
                 Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Our emulators and error
                 estimators are widely applicable to linear systems.",

                 parameter-independent poles and develop new conditions for a
