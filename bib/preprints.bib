  abstract =     "The iterative rational Krylov algorithm (IRKA) is a commonly
                 used fixed-point iteration developed to minimize the
                 {\(\mathcal H_2\)} model order reduction error. In this work,
                 IRKA is recast as a Riemannian gradient descent method with a
                 fixed step size over the manifold of rational functions having
                 fixed degree. This interpretation motivates the development of
                 a Riemannian gradient descent method utilizing as a natural
                 extension variable step size and line search. Comparisons made
                 between IRKA and this extension on a few examples demonstrate
                 significant benefits.",

                 work on {\(\mathcal L_2\)}-optimal reduced-order modeling of
                 stationary parametric problems, in this paper we develop and

                 systems, in particular, for second-order, port-Hamiltonian, and
                 time-delay systems. We show that across all these different
                 structured settings, bitangential Hermite interpolation is the
                 common form for optimality, thus proving a unifying optimality

                 In this work, using the general framework of {\(\mathcal

                 systems with a general pole-residue form. We then specialize
