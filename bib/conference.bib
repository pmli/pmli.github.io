                 the addition of system-theoretic methods. All methods are
                 implemented using pyMOR's abstract interfaces, which allows the
                 application to partial differential equation (PDE) models
                 implemented with third-party libraries. We demonstrate this by
                 applying balanced truncation to a PDE model discretized in

                 systems with identical LTI agents. They propose using Bounded
                 Real Balanced Truncation to preserve a sufficient condition for
                 stability of the coupled system. Here, we extend this idea to
                 arbitrary linearly coupled LTI systems using the sufficient
                 condition for stability introduced by Reis and Stykel. The
                 model reduction error bounds for this method also follow from
                 results of Reis and Stykel, which allows the adaptive choice of
                 reduced orders. We demonstrate the method on Reis's and

                 The method combines an established model order reduction method

                 for reduction, thus preserving structure and consensus. By the

                 can be found which is not necessarily structure preserving.
                 However, based on this we can efficiently find a partition
                 using the QR decomposition with column pivoting as a clustering
                 algorithm, so that the structure can be restored. We illustrate

                 they are related to either graph symmetry or equitable
